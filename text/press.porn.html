<p>
Pornography depicts coercion, violence, rape: it can exemplify this, promote, endure/ embody it.  Porn justifies violence.  Hardcore porn (here pornography is shorthand for hardcore porn) promotes a perception that people should be dominated, humiliated, dehumanized, and even raped and killed. 
</p> <br>
<p>
There is a fine, distinct, line between justifiable preferences and abominable ones. Pedophelia is wrong. And, while, we will agree that homosexuality was considered wrong by many people, and, of course, still is an executable act; yet, rape-culture is allowed. Rape-culture is uncriticized generally— millions of people, including myself, have ready access and ‘get-off' to watching these acts online. This is debaucherous and wrong, banal evil. 
</p><br>
<p>
Many people disagree with my rhetoric; and many people will do so before hearing it to its conclusion— assuming this position is biased unfairly, defeatist, reductionist. akin to totality. However, coming from a place of great concern, rather than piety, I assure you I want to stand for people's' rights here, not take them or hinder them away. 
</p><br>
<p>
... to prey upon vulnerabilities, to exploit,..., these- I am not arguing are intrinsic to pornography or the industry: it is the mentality of exploitation in pornography that so concerns me (not only as an actor in a porn film in college, but) as a consumer of drastic and hard core images.  Images of pain, suffering, inflicted during the act of sex, the nature of which is arousing, as the victim is perceived as wanting and even craving this condition of pain, dominance and submission, (and the giver is perceived as above the law) resulting in isolation from general society), (...[this] I suggest, carries through to our modes of living, especially as defining our sexual roles as men and women,) defining the range of our preferences and importantly our understanding to them.
</p><br>
<p>
The hierarchy of modes of dominance and submission are so strong, so prevalent, we have lost touch with the sexuality implicit in these (and other) human actions; this is particularly relevant in rape (are prevalent even in the absence of women or men^.)  As individual (porn consumers) we are always the interlocutor, making it impossible to separate the fanaticism of rape-culture and discrete acts of rape.
</p><br>
<p>
These two modes of culture (rape culture and sexuality), with semiotic overlap, have differential characteristics; and they do not share symbolic meaning across fields. Thus a person, like myself, can hold drastic, dissonant, points of view: participating in rape culture an mentality by watching rape engendered porn, knowing it is wrong for discrete reasons, and enjoying it. 
</p>
<p>
There are numerous threads— rather than a clear delineation; and as mentioned a prevalence, a hierarchy of modes of suppression, coercion, dominance and submission engendering sexism yields this predicament: a blind discrimination, where rape culture is acceptable: is a sexual preference, and bleeds into our very modes of life: including how men (and women) want to dominate women and men sexually and how men and women want to be dominated sexually.  These are not results of porn (they are  sexist), let me be clear, these modes of operation as we currently realize them are wrong ethically: and this corrupts and compromises the perceptions we have of ourselves and the ones we love: it (this) is inherently dangerous. And (this) could be hindering our realizations of values we would agree upon,
</p><br>
<p>
We could let go completely of these depictions: but let's be clear— that is simply not how the brain works: and if you were to consider an example where you were looking at what you would find on any major porn site today and: were in a future time, (and here) could think and see exactly the type of equality I am espousing you not only agree with my point in the sense of realizing this 'equality' but be careful not to miss my point because I am saying the human brain, as we know it today, cannot see things as they are not, in the sense that I am arguing we need a different set of cognitive values; these, we will engender in our children and we ourselves will and can only strive to realize them. And I promise we cannot fathom the extent to which our children will realize 'values' better than ourselves: and if we do not have this agreement to promote social values and promote the common good, in this argument the common good is against violence and coercive modes of dominance such as sexism and rape. So, and, the common good is to realize a world with-out this problem, just as so many other issues of human-rights and others' rights such as the environment, are so important. One may disagree with the idea that pornography is wrong but how can one disagree with the common good?  Values.
</p><br>
<p>
One interesting thing I have found exploring morality is: holding a moral position is, or can be, against the common intuition such as being vegetarian, pro choice and against the death penalty. Some moral positions get swept away, others are the current, and a true test of a moral position is to stand on firm and solid ground and drive deep, sink deep beneath the current and part all forceful opposition as they may, until either.
